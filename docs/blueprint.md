## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium-dark blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability. This will be used to highlight key elements such as buttons, links, and interactive components.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean, modern, neutral look in light mode.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9800) to draw attention to calls to action and important information. This provides a clear visual contrast against the primary blue.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for titles and headings. Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) for product descriptions and other content. These fonts combine clear legibility with a modern fashion-oriented design aesthetic.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a grid-based layout with clear visual hierarchy to present product listings in an organized and accessible manner. Utilize white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Employ simple, consistent icons to represent product categories, filter options, and other UI elements. These icons should be easily recognizable and contribute to a user-friendly interface.
